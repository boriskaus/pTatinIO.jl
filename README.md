# pTatinIO.jl
The aim of this package is to read files, produced with pTatin3D, back into julia.

Note that it is very much work in progress at this stage

### Installing
Install it through the julia package manager with:
```julia
julia>]
pkg> add https://github.com/boriskaus/pTatinIO.jl
```
Next, use the backspace to return to the julia `REPL` and type:
```julia
julia>using pTatinIO
```
